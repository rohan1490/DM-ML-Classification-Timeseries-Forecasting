# DM-ML-Classification-Timeseries-Forecasting

Implementation of machine learning algorithms in various disciplines has become a need of the hour. Faster and accurate predictions or forecasts can be achieved using supervised machine learning. This paper tests the use of such algorithms in medical, financial and meteorological domains. 
  
  In the medical domain, five classification algorithms are compared to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease. With an accuracy of 75.5%, Support vector machines with linear kernel has been suggested to outperform other classification algorithms. The models tuned for best hyper-parameters using k-fold cross-validation.
  
  In the financial domain, three classification algorithms namely logistic regression, random forests and knn are compared to predict defaulting credit card customers. Random forest with an accuracy of 85.13% are well suited for classifying defaulting redit card customers.
  
  In the third part, ARIMA models have been explored for accurate weather forecasts which produce highly significant results. This research will empower different parties such as medical professionals in diagnosing heart related diseases, banking professionals in customer profiling for funding needs and mteorologists in forecasting temperatures as well other related parameters.
